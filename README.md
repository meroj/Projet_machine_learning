# Projet_machine_learning
In this repository we have 3 csv files which are datasets and 2 pyhton files which are the execution.
We want to predict the weight of someone with regression.

## CSV
We first used the food_coded.csv but there is too few data in this file so the regression is not working very well.
Then we tryed with diet.csv and examination.csv and we have a better result because there is 10 times more values.

## Python
Python is used to import data, clean it, and build a model with cleaned dataset.

  ### Import
  Import csv files with all data
  
  ### Cleaning
  Keep only interesting columns and regularize values(replace null or wrong values)
  
  ### Building
  Use the cleaned data and try to find a model with regression
